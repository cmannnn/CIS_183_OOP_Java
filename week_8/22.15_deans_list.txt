Students make the Dean's list if their GPA is 3.5 or higher. Complete the Course class by implementing the getDeansList() method, which returns an ArrayList of students with a GPA of 3.5 or higher.

Given classes:

Class LabProgram contains the main method for testing the program.
Class Course represents a course, which contains an ArrayList of Student objects as a course roster. (Type your code in here.)
Class Student represents a classroom student, which has three fields: first name, last name, and GPA. (Hint: getGPA() returns a student's GPA.)
Note: For testing purposes, different student values will be used.

Ex. For the following students:

Henry Nguyen 3.5
Brenda Stern 2.0
Lynda Robison 3.2
Sonya King 3.9
the output is:

Dean's list:
Henry Nguyen (GPA: 3.5)
Sonya King (GPA: 3.9)
