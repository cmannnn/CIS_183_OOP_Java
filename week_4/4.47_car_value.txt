Given main(), complete the Car class (in file Car.java) with methods to set and get the purchase price of a car (setPurchasePrice(), getPurchasePrice()), and to output the car's information (printInfo()).

Ex: If the input is:

2011
18000
2018
where 2011 is the car's model year, 18000 is the purchase price, and 2018 is the current year, the output is:

Car's information:
   Model year: 2011
   Purchase price: 18000
   Current value: 5770
Note: printInfo() should use three spaces for indentation.
