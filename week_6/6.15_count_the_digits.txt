Write a recursive method called digitCount() that takes a positive integer as a parameter and returns the number of digits in the integer. Hint: The number of digits increases by 1 whenever the input number is divided by 10.

Ex: If the input is:

345
the method digitCount() returns and the program outputs:

3
