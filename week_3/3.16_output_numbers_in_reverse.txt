Write a program that reads a list of integers and outputs those integers in reverse. The input begins with an integer indicating the number of integers that follow. For coding simplicity, follow each output integer by a comma, including the last one. Assume that the list will always contain fewer than 20 integers.

Ex: If the input is:

5 2 4 6 8 10
the output is:

10,8,6,4,2,
To achieve the above, first read the integers into an array. Then output the array in reverse.
