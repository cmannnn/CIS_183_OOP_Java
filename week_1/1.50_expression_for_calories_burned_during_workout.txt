The following equations estimate the calories burned when exercising (source):

Women: Calories = ( (Age x 0.074) — (Weight x 0.05741) + (Heart Rate x 0.4472) — 20.4022 ) x Time / 4.184

Men: Calories = ( (Age x 0.2017) + (Weight x 0.09036) + (Heart Rate x 0.6309) — 55.0969 ) x Time / 4.184

Write a program using inputs age (years), weight (pounds), heart rate (beats per minute), and time (minutes), respectively. Output calories burned for women and men.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
System.out.printf("%.2f", yourValue);

Ex: If the input is:

49 155 148 60
the output is:

Women: 580.94 calories
Men: 891.47 calories
